 Our main function starts like this\-: 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 First we create a object {\ttfamily t} of the \hyperlink{class_test}{Test} class. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 Then we call the example member function 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
 After that our little test routine ends. 
\begin{DoxyCodeInclude}

\end{DoxyCodeInclude}
